Workflow enable automatic proccessing .mzML files from watched folder and saving quality control (QC) metrics to database. 

There is necessary to set the info before running the workflow in the first metanode of the workflow Folder and file format to watch. There has to be set path to folder to watch, path to database file (paths could be relative to knime workspace) and path to python executable and set extension of files which will be proccessed. Then there is required to set path to .fasta files in every metanode obtaining qc metrics, setting of .fasta file paths is possible to find here: File proccessing and saving to database – Obtaining qc metrics – Identification and feature finding – Input files (Protein database FASTA).

There are proccessed automatically new .mzML files in folder after running the workflow or there is possible to set files for processing by highlighting files in Sorter node in the workflow. 

Workflow is devided by instrument type in the metanode File processing and saving to database but initialization is in python script Wf initialization by instrument. Instrument is defined by its shortcut in .mzML file name. Instrument name, its shortcuts and ids has to be defined also in database table Instruments. MzML file has to be named in specific way: QC_instrument_QC type_amount in ng_additional info about LC and MS method as per your need.

There are also acquired graphs from metrics which are saved in ./DATA/database_data/images/ where folder DATA is your selected folder relative to KNIME workspace in first component of workflow. Graphs are saved with filename defined by identifiers (id). Those ids are current run id (ID_run from database table Runs), current  metric id ( ID_run_quality from database table Run_qualities) and id of metric (accession from database table qc_vocabulary) shown in the graph. So filenames of graphs are in the form: accession_ID-run_ ID-run-quality.svg. 

Database has this structure (link to github with structure image?). Database is possible generate with workflow (link to github with wf?). There are saved informations from run (.mzML file) into database. So there is possible to read from database informations about runs date, time, used quality standard and its amount, instrument, quality metrics, folder and filename used for obtaining quality metrics. Metrics are obtained from files .qcML and .mzQC, which are generated in wf. Used metrics are defined in database table qc_vocabulary. If any metric is visualized in graph there is saved path to graph instead of values of metric into database.
Workflow also saves info with logging (wf logs info if obtaining metrics was successful and if saving was successful into database) in file ./DATA/logging/quality_control.log. There are also saved files from processing data into folder DATA. Files idXML from peptide identification are saved into folder notrecal_idXMLs. Files idXML from mapping identifications and features are saved into folder  notrecal_idXMLs2. CSV files from protein quantification are saved into folder notrecal_protein and there are also saved mzQC files with aquired metrics into folder notrecal_mzQCs_full.Workflow enable automatic proccessing .mzML files from watched folder and saving quality control (QC) metrics to database.
