Inputs folder
====================

The _inputs_ folder should contain the file(s) for processing, in this case the proteinGroups.txt file, an output of the MaxQuant software (http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=maxquant:start).
In general, the workflow is applicable to any data in the wide table format; however, additional adjustments of nodes settings may be required then.
